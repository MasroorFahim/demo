# House price analysis by ann, a deep learning approach
hello, so here we gonna take a dataset of housingdataset and see what we can do with the dataset.
We will
1.Import the necessary packages.
2.visualise the columns in the data and check the variance threshold to check whether there is any non zero columns in the dataset.
3.Data Preprocessing and cleaning and it will be generally be donw with some plotting and perason correlation techniques
4.Training and testing split
5.Scaling/Minmax Scaling and normalization
6.Building model (ANN)
7.Five Metrics are used and they are 1.R2_score,2.Mean_absolute_error,3.mean_squared_error,4.Mean_squared_log_error and 5.Explained_variance_score and Score
8.Predictive System with the actual price.
